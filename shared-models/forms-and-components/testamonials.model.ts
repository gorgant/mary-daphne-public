    testamonialText: `I am a client of Mary's at Explearning. I hired her to improve my communication skills with focus on public speaking. I was preparing for a job search and I also wanted to improve my public speaking skills. She coached me in effective public speaking, interview skills, and general communication skills. The sessions included fact based teaching, hands-on learning through scenarios and simulations, and public speaking practice. Mary impressed me by being very competent, knowledgeable and with great insights, at the same time as being confident, approachable and professional.  I recommend anyone wanting to improve their communication skills to get in contact with Mary.`,

Although I felt extremely nervous at first, she always kept a big smile on her face and provided me constructive feedback on how I could present myself as a qualified and confident PhD applicant. I was admitted to the PhD program successfully. I’d like to really thank her for the kind of help she had given me during our practice. I would highly recommend her to anyone who’d like to enhance their speaking skills for academic and/or business purposes!',

    testamonialText: `I want to thank you for your skills in teaching, educating, and encouraging me to continue with my studies. You speak to students with respect, kindness and tenderness. If I were asked to describe the “art of teaching”, I would proudly say, “Mary Daphne”.  You were very calm and charming and for that we love you. Communicating effectively can be very difficult, but that was not my case with Mary D., she always knew how to approach. She is very knowledgeable and that makes it really interesting to learn with her. She knew where to begin and where to end; where to start and where to stop. She inspired me in so many ways, and for that I truly admire her. She makes you feel talented and smart, and knows how to appreciate students.`,

I recommend MD as a teacher, she is wonderful and has a unique energy.
